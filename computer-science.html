    <h1>What is Computer Science?</h1>

    <div class="text">
        <p>Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer
            engineers,
            computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design,
            development, and application.</p>

        <p> Principal areas of study within Computer Science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and
            networks,
            security, database systems, human computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming
            languages, software engineering, bioinformatics and theory of computing.</p>

        <p>Although knowing how to program is essential to the study of computer science, it is only one element of the
            field. Computer scientists design and analyze algorithms to solve programs and study the performance of
            computer
            hardware and software. The problems that computer scientists encounter range from the abstract - determining
            what problems can be solved with computers and the complexity of the algorithms that solve them - to the
            tangible - designing applications that perform well on handheld devices, that are easy to use, and that
            uphold
            security measures.</p>
